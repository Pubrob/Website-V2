          <div class="item1"><h1>The Minigun</h1> <p>The stock minigun is one of Heavies best primary weapons and considered by some heavies best weapon. It has constant damage at close range forgiving spread. Decent rev up time and overall a very strong choice. It is versatile in all situations the heavy will find himself in. Overall a great weapon to use when starting out Heavy</p></div>
       <div class="item2"><img src="images/minigun.jpg" width="100%" height="450"></div>
          <div class="item3"><h2>Tomislav</h2><p>The Tomislav competes very close to the Stock Minigun. Many including myself consider it a stronger choice as it is more consistent at range with the tighter spread. Increasing accuracy at range means more bullets hit a further range. Where it falls behind the stock is at close range. Due to slower firing speed. Play with both Tomislav and Stock and pick a favourite</p></div>
       <div class="item4"><img src="images/tomislav.jpg" width="100%" height="450"></div>
        <div class="item5"><h2>The Huo-Long Heater</h2> <p>The Huo-Long Heater is an interesting choice. It's not a bad weapon but is out-classed by both Stock and Tomislav. Its reduced damage means it has a lower damage output. The ring of fire sounds like a cool stat but doesn't come into play too often. Where this weapon shines is cart heavy. Recommend for cart heavy play style.</p></div>
       <div class="item6"><img src="images/huolong.jpg" width="100%" height="450"></div>
          <div class="item7"><h2>Natascha. </h2><p>Another weapon that isn't bad just outclassed by other choices. It has one major downside -25% damage meaning its damage output is much lower compared to other heavy primary weapons. But it's upside of slowing enemies down is very useful for dealing with pisky scouts. If scouts are an issue for you the Natascha counters them nicely.</p></div>
       <div class="item8"><img src="images/natascha.jpg" width="100%" height="450"></div>
               <div class="item9"><h2>The Brass Beast</h2><p>A pretty bad choice overall for general play and use. Its crazy slow rev up time and slow movement speed when revved up makes you a prime target to get picked off by snipers and spies. It is a very defensive weapon so practically useless on attack. Do not recommend using this weapon</p></div>
