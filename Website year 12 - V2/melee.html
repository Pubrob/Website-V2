 <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="item1"><h1>Stock fists</h1> <p>Heavies stock fists the ones you get when you first boot up the game are not very useful. Heavies melees serve more of a utility purpose and not for damage dealing. Heavy has the highest DPM(Damage Per Minute) primary weapon in the game meaning having a damage dealing melee weapon is not viable. Other melees like the Fists of Steel tend to outclass the stock fists.</p></div>
       <div class="item2">  <a href="images/fists.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/fists.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
                    </a></div>
          <div class="item3"><h2>The Warrior's Spirit.</h2><p>Heavies worst weapon due to one massive downside. 30% damage vulnerability. This means for example if a rocket were due to do a base damage of 100. With the increased damage vulnerability that rocket would then deal a massive 130 damage. Heavy is the tank class made for soaking up damage. Having an item that makes him less tanky is a no go. Avoid this weapon.</p></div>
       <div class="item4"><a href="images/sprit.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/sprit.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
                    </a></div>
        <div class="item5"><h2>The Fists Of Steel</h2> <p>Heavies most useful and versatile melee weapon. It has one outstanding stat that being the -40% damage from ranged sources while active. Meaning you take 40% less damage from everything but melee weapons while you hold the fists. Allowing you to tank massive amount of damage. For example a headshot dealing 150 damage will now only do 90 damage. With a bit of practice this becomes the go to choice for many heavy players. Highly recommended choice. </p></div>
       <div class="item6"><a href="images/steel.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/steel.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
                    </a></div>
          <div class="item7"><h2>The Gloves Of Running Urgently</h2><p>A very strong choice for heavy players looking to be more of a mobile and flanking playstyle. Having that 30% extra movement speed while the gloves are active allows heavy to move much quicker and get to the front lines faster. I recommend using this melee if there is no teleporter present for faster travel time to the front line. </p></div>
       <div class="item8"><a href="images/gru.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/gru.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
           </a></div>
               <div class="item9"><h2>The Holiday Punch</h2><p>The Holiday Punch is quite an interesting weapon and is considered more of a “joke” weapon. Meaning it's more intended for a fun time. It's a regular choice for friendly players and on joke servers. In terms of actual use it is a straight upgrade of stock but falls behind more competitive choices like the GRU and Fists of steel. Recommend for a bit of fun.</p></div>
       <div class="item10"><a href="images/holiday.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/holiday.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
                    </a></div>
               <div class="item11"><h2>The Killing Gloves Of Boxing.</h2><p>The KGB is another weapon that is a straight upgrade from the stock fists but falls behind the other weapons like the GRU and Fists Of Steel. The KGB is a powerful choice with the 5 second crits but in actual use isn’t a very strong competitive heavy choice with only one upside.</p></div>
       <div class="item12"><a href="images/kgb.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/kgb.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
                    </a></div>
               <div class="item13"><h2>The Eviction Notice</h2><p>Another fun choice weapon to use when messing around. The Eviction Notice was once a strong choice until the stats were changed and now is a downgraded version of the GRU. I don’t recommend using this weapon as other melees do its job better and more efficiently. </p></div>
       <div class="item14"><a href="images/notice.jpg" data-lightbox="example-set">
                         <img class="example-image" src="images/notice.jpg" width="100%" height="450">
